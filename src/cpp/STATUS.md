# PhoenixDRS Professional - Project Status

This document summarizes the current development status of the PhoenixDRS Professional C++ GUI application.

## Overall Status: Fully Functional Core

The application has been built from a skeleton project into a fully functional tool with multiple core data recovery features. All foundational elements are in place, including a professional UI, multi-threaded operation handlers, and robust back-end components.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Core Infrastructure
- **Project Structure:** All necessary files (`.h`, `.cpp`, `.ui`) and directories (`src`, `include`, `ui`, `resources`, `tests`) are in place.
- **Build System:** `CMakeLists.txt` is fully configured to build the application, including all newly created files and the GoogleTest framework for testing.
- **UI Framework:** The application is built on Qt6 with a modern, dark-themed UI. The main window uses a tabbed interface for different functionalities.
- **Logging:** A thread-safe `ForensicLogger` is integrated throughout the application, writing to both a session log and a case-specific log file.
- **Settings:** A `SettingsDialog` allows for persistent application configuration.
- **Performance Monitoring:** A `PerformanceMonitor` displays real-time CPU and memory usage in the status bar.

### 2. Case Management
- **Status:** **Complete**
- **Description:** A full case management system (`CaseManager`) has been implemented.
  - Users can create new cases, which generates a structured directory for outputs and logs.
  - Users can open existing cases.
  - All operations (Imaging, Carving) are context-aware and save their output to the active case directory.
  - The UI is disabled until a case is opened, ensuring a forensically sound workflow.

### 3. Disk Imager
- **Status:** **Complete & Integrated**
- **Description:** The advanced `DiskImager` engine is fully integrated.
  - It runs in a separate thread to keep the UI responsive.
  - Supports forensic imaging of disk images or physical devices (platform-dependent).
  - Calculates MD5 and SHA256 hashes during imaging.
  - Provides detailed progress updates (speed, percentage, data processed) to the UI.
  - The UI allows for source/destination selection, starting, and canceling the operation.

### 4. File Carver
- **Status:** **Complete & Integrated**
- **Description:** The advanced `FileCarver` engine is fully integrated.
  - It runs in a separate thread.
  - Loads file signatures from an external `signatures.json` file.
  - Scans a source image for file headers and carves the corresponding data.
  - Displays carved files in a results table in real-time as they are found.
  - Provides progress updates to the UI.

### 5. RAID Reconstructor
- **Status:** **Partially Complete & Integrated**
- **Description:** The `RaidReconstructor` has been significantly upgraded and integrated.
  - The UI allows for adding/removing disk images, selecting the RAID level, and setting the stripe size.
  - **RAID 0 (Stripe)** reconstruction is implemented.
  - **RAID 5 (Distributed Parity)** reconstruction logic is implemented, including XOR parity calculation for data recovery.
  - The operation runs on the main thread for now (needs to be moved to a worker thread for production).

### 6. Video Rebuilder
- **Status:** **Partially Complete & Integrated**
- **Description:** The `VideoRebuilder` has been upgraded and integrated.
  - The UI allows selecting a source video, output path, and format.
  - **MP4/MOV:** Implemented an improved algorithm that finds and re-orders the essential `ftyp`, `moov`, and `mdat` atoms.
  - **AVI:** Basic support has been added to the backend, but the implementation is a placeholder.

## Next Steps & Areas for Improvement

1.  **Multithreading for RAID/Video:** Move the `RaidReconstructor` and `VideoRebuilder` operations to worker threads to prevent UI freezing, consistent with the Imager and Carver.
2.  **Advanced RAID Features:** Implement auto-detection of RAID parameters (stripe size, disk order, parity layout), which is a critical feature for professional use. Add support for more RAID levels (e.g., RAID 6, RAID 10).
3.  **Advanced Video Recovery:** Fully implement the AVI recovery logic. Integrate a more robust library like FFmpeg (as hinted in the advanced headers) to handle a wider variety of codecs and repair more complex corruptions.
4.  **Reporting:** Implement a feature to generate a final report (TXT or PDF) summarizing all actions taken within a case, including hashes, files recovered, and logs.
5.  **UI Polish:**
    - Add more detailed controls for each operation (e.g., hash selection in Imager, file type selection in Carver).
    - Provide more detailed results (e.g., a hex view for selected files).
    - Improve error handling and user feedback.
6.  **Testing:** Add comprehensive unit tests for the newly implemented logic in all components.
