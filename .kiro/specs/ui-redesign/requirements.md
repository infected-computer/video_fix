# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves a complete redesign of the PhoenixDRS application user interface based on the modern Desktop App Kit design from Figma. The current application has a command-line interface and basic functionality, but needs a modern, professional desktop GUI that follows the Desktop App Kit design system with proper component usage, 8pt spacing system, and comprehensive accessibility support.

The redesign will transform the existing CLI-based video recovery tool into a modern desktop application using reusable components from the Design Kit, including Sidebar, Toolbar, Modal, Card, ListItem, Button, and other standardized components that ensure consistency and maintainability.

## Requirements
